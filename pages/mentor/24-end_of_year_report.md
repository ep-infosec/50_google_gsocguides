Phew! You made it. There may have been some rough spots along the way, perhaps even some failures, but you made it. Your work is *almost* done. It's time to take a look back and produce an End-of-Year Report. Make it fun and it'll be painless. Heck, people might even read it!

The report should be written for a general audience, so include an introduction to your organization and your main goals. You might mention how many years you've participated in GSoC and the number of GSoC contributors you've mentored. Depending on how many projects you ran, you should highlight what they were about, how much code was written, and code integration plans. Were there any special events or face-to-face meetings over the summer? Any positive surprises?

In the end, the report is all about the GSoC contributors. Be sure to mention any blogs that were maintained by your GSoC contributors, and any public references to their work. Links to screenshots or video demonstrations are quite effective. Including GSoC contributor quotes is a fun way to represent not only their experience but also your organization, through the eyes of new contributors.
